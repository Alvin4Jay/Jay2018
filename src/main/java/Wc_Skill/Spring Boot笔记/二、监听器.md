##监听器`Listener`

###1.监听事件`Event`

Spring Boot启动时的事件发布阶段  0初始化器、注册监听器---1---环境准备---2---context创建---3---refresh---4----runner-----5启动完成

- ApplicationStartingEvent    1阶段，环境准备就绪之前，初始化器、注册监听器之后
- ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent 2阶段，环境准备就绪，context未创建
- ApplicationPreparedEvent   3阶段，context创建完成，但还没refreshed。 bean定义未加载完全
- ApplicationStartedEvent  4阶段，context refresh完成
- ApplicationReadyEvent  5阶段，启动完成
- ApplicationFailedEvent 启动失败

    
    An ApplicationStartingEvent is sent at the start of a run but before any processing, except for the registration of listeners and initializers.
    An ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent is sent when the Environment to be used in the context is known but before the context is created.
    An ApplicationPreparedEvent is sent just before the refresh is started but after bean definitions have been loaded.
    An ApplicationStartedEvent is sent after the context has been refreshed but before any application and command-line runners have been called.
    An ApplicationReadyEvent is sent after any application and command-line runners have been called. It indicates that the application is ready to service requests.
    An ApplicationFailedEvent is sent if there is an exception on startup.
    
###2.实现监听器

    (1)监听类实现ApplicationListener接口，选择对应监听事件 
    (2)将监听类添加到SpringApplication实例  SpringApplication app.addListeners(new MyListener());
